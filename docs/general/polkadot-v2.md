Understanding what Polkadot 1.0 is about, and the philosophy behind it, will help us to envision the
future direction of the ecosystem toward abstraction and generalization.

Underlying resources that chains need Platform for people to build applications and people to use
those app

Provider of resilient general-purpose continuation computation broad long-running task than can do
something, pause, and do some more stuff

parachins within this new perspective

multicore computer all operating at the same time on different tasks chains that operate on a core
are called parachains reserved core to continuously operate on

50 corse continuously operating in parallel --> 500-1000 possible with optimizations within the next
few years

benchmarking, performance

- Bandwidth: ~1MB/s
- Compute: Geekbench 5 SC score ~380
- Latency: 6s (time between two consecutive tasks)

Cores can be used to secure parachains as well as smart contracts, this avoids the need of custom
chain infrastructure, effective for contracts with constrained state and heavy compute requirements

Cores are agile --> procurement must be agile too corse can change what job they are doing slot
auction mechanism is not agile --> designed for long running single chains, creates high barriers

Core Rental, not Slot Auction

Coretime (blockspace) can be sold

- bull: monthly sale of 4 weeks Coretime at a fixed price, target 75% of available cores and
  unrented cores go to instantaneous market its an asset, does not need to be directly deployed

- instantaneous: Ongoing sale of Coretime for immediate use at a spot price, AMM regulates the price
  targeting 100% usage, bulk coretime can be placed in this market, sale revenues split between
  Coretime providers (validators) Purchased by parachains though collators, boost throughput with
  extra cores, reduce latency with extra cores, power more exotic things like core contracts
